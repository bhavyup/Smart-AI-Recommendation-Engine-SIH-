## üß† AI Algorithm Details

### Matching Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring approach with the following components:

1. **Skill Matching (30% weight)**
   - Compares candidate skills with internship requirements
   - Uses fuzzy matching for skill variations
   - Considers skill relevance and depth

2. **Location Preference (20% weight)**
   - Exact location matches get highest score
   - Rural-friendly internships get bonus for rural candidates
   - Regional proximity considerations

3. **Education Level (20% weight)**
   - Exact education level matches preferred
   - Higher education candidates can apply to lower-level positions
   - Structured education hierarchy

4. **Sector Interest (15% weight)**
   - Matches candidate interests with internship sectors
   - Multiple interest support
   - Cross-sector compatibility

5. **Diversity & Affirmative Action (15% weight)**
   - Rural area origin bonus
   - Social category considerations (SC/ST/OBC)
   - First-generation graduate support
   - Diversity-focused internship preferences

### Scoring Formula
```
Overall Score = (Skill √ó 0.3) + (Location √ó 0.2) + (Education √ó 0.2) + (Sector √ó 0.15) + (Diversity √ó 0.15)
```
